# Visit Stará Ľubovňa

Hello there! This repo is an attempt to publish the most comprehensive guide to Stará Ľubovňa region (including Pieniny National Park), giving a little competition to the official (and commercial) tourist websites. Living in the town for more than 30 years and being naturally curious about the region I think I have visited basically everything there is to see in the surroundings. So get ready for a load of high-quality (and opinionated maybe) content!

## Motivation

It has been a long-living idea of mine to provide tourists with a comprehensive guide to my little, under-visited region. While tourist agencies (of national or regional level) do publish websites and leaflets of various quality, they are all inevitably commercial, listing only selected attractions and services (that pay for that of course). Benefiting from many travelogues in my travels, I want to give back to the community and provide a comprehensive guide to the region, from top spots to hidden gems and local secrets.

## Why Astro?

I have a long list of technologies I want to try. Astro is one of them, and with title including "for content-driven websites" and desc continuing with "powers the world's fastest marketing sites, blogs, e-commerce websites, and more", I believe it is the best match for this, at least now, seemingly static website.

## Why now?

A situation with my current job allows for that. Also, I purchased `visitstaralubovna.com` already, so there is no turning back!

## Why git?

It is true I could just use WordPress or any other headless CMS (or even WordPress on itself!), but I guess it will be fun to review the evolution of this website in the future. Also, this format allows others to contribute, too!

## What's next?

[ ] Review high-quality websites for content categorization
[ ] Start adding content - doesn't need to be perfect, doesn't need to be visually appealing - content is king, right?
[ ] Analytics - only that will ultimately decide what categories and content type is the most valuable to visitors
